# nAChR_apoptosis-proteins-interaction

This is the project to write a code to make able to analyse two proteins and check whether the interation is possible and what kind interaction is it. It must be code which you can apply to any pair of proteins, but currently I test my application on two proteins, which I predownload and had possitive interation in PyDockWeb. 

The code is not finished yet.
